						<h2>What are we doing with Rules as Code?</h2>

					<ul>
						<li>Manually translating <em>prescriptive</em> rules into computer code</li>
						<li>Publishing this translation, so computer systems can use it</li>
						<li>Testing our interpretation of the rules with clear, reproducible test data</li>
					</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
					<h2>Why Code The Rules?</h2>

					<p>Every computer system that interacts with rules, codes them</p>
					</section>
					<section>
					<h2>Let's do it once</h2>

					<p>So that everyone uses the same rules, with the same terms that mean the same things</p>
					</section>
					<section>
					<h2>Let's do it better</h2>

					<ul>
						<li>Computers read rules depending strictly on what is told to them - if a computer can read it, it's unambiguous<br>
						 </li>
						<li>Rules and computer systems become easier to integrate with, test, and modify<br>
						 </li>
						<li>By reducing the burden of understanding legislation, we improve our customer's experience</li>
					</ul>
					</section>

						<p>What's the important question here?</p>

					<h2>DCS's Approach</h2>
					<p>DCS's aim is to make Rules as Code the easiest approach for drafting, consulting, implementing and communicating prescriptive rules and legislation.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>The big question for the ESS is...</h3>
						<p><span>How can we use Rules as Code to inform implementation of the Rule?</span></p>
						<p><span>(and how can we find this out?)</span></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>What we've done so far is...</h3>
						<p><span>Worked with DCS to learn how to build a Rules as Code coding environment.</span></p>
						<p><span>Coded the NABERS method of the Rule (for Offices and Apartments).</span></p>
						<p><span>Built test cases for the use of this method.</span></p>
						<p><span>Reviewed the code with Legal.</span></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>We've learned a lot from this process...</h3>
						<p><span>There's lots of insights that have emerged from this process.</span></p>

				<h3>What's so special about months?</h3>
					<p>A month is a common concept that appears everywhere in law and business.</p>
					<p>It appears in the ESS a few times, such as in 8.8.8:</p>
						<img width="100%" alt="Down arrow" data-lazy-loaded="" data-src="img/section_8_8_8.png">
					</section>
					<section>
					<p>But what exactly <em>is</em> a month?</p>
					<p>Let's see what the law says.</p>
					</section>
					<section data-background-iframe="https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/1987/15/part2/sec21" data-background-interactive>
						<div style="position: absolute; width: 40%; left: 0; box-shadow: 0 1px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.5), 0 5px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9); color: #fff; padding: 20px; font-size: 20px; text-align: left;">
						<p>This is the definition of months in the Interpretations Act.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3> The legal interpretation of this definition. </h3>
						<p> So for (a), a month begins on 12:00:01am on 15 July, and ends on 11:59:59pm on 14 August. </p>
						<p> For (b), a month begins on 12:00:01am on 31 August, and ends on 11:59:59pm on 30 September. </p>
						<p> This functionality is difficult to replicate in code. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3> What we did with this information. </h3>
						<p> It takes writing approx. 40 lines of code to build a function to replicate this functionality - which we did. </p>
						<p> There's an interesting finding we found, in codifying the strict legal interpretation of a common term and applying test cases to it. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p> Here's a test case that looks at 8.8.8, specifically at leap years.<p>
